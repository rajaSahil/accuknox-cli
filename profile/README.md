## Profiling of Kubearmor Logs using accuknox-cli

`accuknox-cli profile` which shows real-time terminal user interface table of three different operations going on in KubeArmor: Process, File and Network. It maintains a counter of each operation that is happening within the cluster, along with other useful details. It directly fetches data from the `accuknox-cli logs` API and displays all the required information. The TUI includes simple navigation between operations and a user input based filter as well.
